## Requirements
```zsh
$ mv .env.example .env # and put of data;
# It is necessary to configure the yt-dlp utility;
# You need to have ffmpeg on the machine;
# Paths must have write and read permission;
# If you are going to use systemd change the data to match your machine;
# ...
# and yes... Facebook has the feat of needing different tokens for publishing and media publishing
```

the climb to the server is like the Incas did...
